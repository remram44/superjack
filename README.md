This is a digital version of the card game Superjack, a game similar to Magic: The Gathering (or Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Hearthstone) but played with two regular decks of cards.

Find out more about Superjack on [the official website](https://www.superjackthegame.com/) or [repository](https://github.com/superjackthegame/sjthegame).

See also my [formalization of the game's rules as a UML state chart](formal-rules/).

Goal
====

The goal of this project is to implement the rules of Superjack in code. Once that is done, a web-based UI can be developed, so the game can be played online. A simple AI could also be devised.

Status
======

I am still implementing the game's rules, with a simple text-based UI. Once I am satisfied with my implementation of the game's rules, I will move on to the other aspects of making a computer game.
